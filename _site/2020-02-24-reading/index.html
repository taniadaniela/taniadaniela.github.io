<p>One of my goals for 2019 was to read more, my idea was to read at least one book per month. I failed at this goal, and honestly I failed fantastically, because I started to read 5 books, and I couldn’t finished a single one. My reading list of articles increased daily but I was not able to go down.</p>

<p>The reasons because I failed in this goal are distractions and tiredness. By the end of a work day,  my brain was really tired to dedicate another hour for reading, and during the day when having some free time I ended up spending those minutes in social networks. Yeah, as I said I failed fantastically.</p>

<p>But this post is not about my huge failure, instead is about how I end up improving my amount of reading.</p>

<p>So at the last days of December I was talking with a friend about the New Year goals, and I mentioned my failure on the reading goal, and I was like “you know what will be really cool?, if the app for saving lecture links could also read you with a cool voice, not too much robotic, so while you are like cleaning the dishes you could hear the articles you save” and he told me: 
“You already use pocket and it has that functionality”</p>

<p>And there was the answer to fix my lecture issue. An app that I was already using but I never notices about that functionality and then I lighting strike again, I have a kindle touch from 2012, with guess what? speakers and jack port.</p>

<p>So, in just a week, I have listened to 8 articles of my pocket list and I have listened to 2 chapters of one of my books in the kindle, all this happened while I was washing the dishes and cleaning my apartment.</p>

<p>I end up using all the tools I already have but in a little different way.</p>
